Designing and shaping the cities, towns, and villages is part of the Urban design process. This helps us plan the better use of public spaces around us. Better Urban design can help us fight today’s biggest challenges: expanding population, mass urbanization, rising inequality, and climate changes.

Physical models of the cities or towns are built to see if the design is best to manage all the issues. We are in the digital world era, so instead of spending money on making a physical model, with the computer programming power, you are going to help the Mayor of the city see the augmented city. This has a plus point too. If we don't, like the final design, we don’t have to build a new physical model; the computer program can easily do it.

Write an A-Frame program, which will use barcode markers (with unique values) to render buildings, streets, etc.
